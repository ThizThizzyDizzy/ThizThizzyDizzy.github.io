                I've written descriptions of my VR setup in a few places, but they're all at least somewhat outdated by now.
                Therefore, here's a full run through my current VR setup, and all the relevant other things required to make it work.
            </p>
            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <h4>Other Stuff</h4>
            <div class='centered'>
                <img style="float: left; height: 14em;" src="img/vr_charging_rack.jpg" alt="A wooden charging rack holding many VR devices">
                <p style="max-width: 40em;">I also made a charging rack that holds my controllers, most of my trackers and bhaptics stuff, and a couple of charging hubs to plug them all into.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Headset</h3>
            <p>I currently use the Pimax Crystal, with the lighthouse faceplate and DMAS Earphones.</p>
            <p>I also have a bunch of kiwi VR pulleys for tether management.</p>
            <p>I added a Studioform Apache Strap to significantly increase the comfort of the headset</p>
            <p>The bHaptics Tactal (Standard size) fits nicely on the Crystal</p>
            <p>I also have my vive facial tracker attached, using <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6374402/files>this mount</a></p>
            <h3>Base Stations</h3>
            <div class='centered'>
                <img style='float: left; height: 10em;' src='img/vr_base_station.jpg' alt="A K'nex bracket holding a base station onto the top of a tripod">
                <p style='max-width: 40em;'>I have four base stations; Two are attached to the wall, and two are mounted to tripods originally designed for holding a green screen, using a K'nex adapter.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Controllers and FBT</h3>
            <p>I currently use a pair of Valve Index Controllers.</p>
            <p>My waist tracker is attached via a VRChat edition belt strap.</p>
            <p>My foot trackers are attached to my KatVR shoes with some <a href=https://github.com/ThizThizzyDizzy/VR-Hardware-Accessories/tree/main/Tundra%20Tracker/KatVR%20Shoelace%20Mount>shoelace-mounting baseplates</a>.</p>
            <p>For my elbow and knee trackers, I modified a track suit with magnetic mounting points, which are paired with <a href=https://github.com/ThizThizzyDizzy/VR-Hardware-Accessories/tree/main/Tundra%20Tracker/Magnetic%20Sewing%20Mount>magnetic baseplates</a>. I also used some v1 "chips" with a connector to act as tensioners, to ensure the trackers don't flop around. (Note that the magnets are not strong enough for vicious movements)</p>
            <p>My chest tracker is attached via my old TrackBelt.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.5em">Fun fact: I used a track suit purely because it has the word <strong>track</strong> in its name
            <h3>Accessories</h3>
            <p>I have a number of other accessories, including many bHaptics devices, a Kat Walk C2+, and an owoskin.</p>
            <p>The bHaptics Tactosy Feet's foot straps interfere with the low-friction of the katVR shoes, so I moved them up my leg a bit and use them as ankle haptics</p>
            <p>The Kat Walk's harness collides with my belt tracker, so I attached a vive tracker to it with electrical tape, which I use as my waist tracker while on the Kat Walk.</p>
            <h3>Future Things</h3>
            <p>There's a number of additional things I'm still working on.</p>
            <h4>Chest tracker mounting</h4>
            <p>My TrackBelt is not a great solution for holding my chest tracker; it tends to move a lot and requires frequent adjustment or recalibration. While I could replace this with a different kind of strap, I would prefer something that would be certain to not move around.</p>
            <p>I'm making a <a href=https://github.com/ThizThizzyDizzy/VR-Hardware-Accessories/tree/main/Tundra%20Tracker/Flat%20Baseplate>flat baseplate</a> with velcro attached, to attach it to my TactSuit in place of the emblem patch.</p>
            <h4>LucidVR Gloves</h4>
            <p>I've been working on a pair of LucidVR gloves for a while, but I've had a lot of issues with the 3D printed parts. I think I've solved most of the issues, but it's going to take a little while to finish them.</p>
            <p>I'm building them onto bHaptics gloves, and sewing the finger guides onto the gloves' outer linings.</p>
            <p>My current hardware modifications can be found <a href=https://github.com/ThizThizzyDizzy/VR-Hardware-Accessories/tree/main/LucidVR>here</a>, although they are definitely WIP.</p>
            <p>I also plan to attach a bunch of inputs to these, although I'm not sure which ones I'll be using just yet. Various things I've collected to try include: Full-size joysticks, trackpads, and low-profile mechanical keyboard switches (because I couldn't find satisfactory buttons)</p>
            <h3>Old Stuff</h3>
            <p>This section covers things I previously used, but have since been replaced.</p>
            <h4>Valve Index</h4>
            <p>The index was my first headset, and I used it up until I got my crystal.</p>
            <p>I added a Studioform Apache Strap to it, although it didn't make a significant difference for me (the index was pretty comfy already)</p>
            <p>I attached my vive facial tracker using <a href=https://github.com/ThizThizzyDizzy/VR-Hardware-Accessories/tree/main/Headset/Valve%20Index/Magnetic%20Facial%20Tracker%20Mount>this magnetic mount</a>.</p>
            <p>I also had a couple iterations of EyeTrackVR eye trackers attached.</p>
            <p>I made some <a href=https://github.com/ThizThizzyDizzy/VR-Hardware-Accessories/tree/main/Headset/Valve%20Index/Clips>clips</a> to attach my tactal controller (since the velcro didn't sit well on the index), eyeTrackVR controller boards, and a USB hub to the headset.</p>
            <h4>Various straps</h4>
            <p>Tracker straps I have previously used:</p>
            <p>Rebuff Reality TrackStraps, but they wore out in less than a month.</p>
            <p>VRChat edition arm & knee straps, which still work, but were replaced by my magnetic mounting system. This was because they tended to move around, and the arm straps were wearing out too.</p>
